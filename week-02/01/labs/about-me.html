   <p> My name is Rhea Patel. I am from New Jersey and I am a junior in the Syracuse University School of information studies. Currently I am taking IST 263, 345 and 323. They are all very interesting classes. My goal is to be in security when I am older, and my end goal is to be an Information Security Officer for a large company, maybe financial or other, but definetly in New York City. I think that the iSchool by far is the best school on Syracuse University campus </p>
   <p> I am from Franklin Lakes NJ which is in northern NJ, close to New York City and the NY state border. At home, I like to go on hikes with my family and go to the gym. I enjoy physical activities other than hiking such as swimming, running, and indoor cycling. I have many friends at home and at school, and I am always making plans with them to hang out. </p>
   <p>A fun fact about me is that in 2016 I started my own beading company called Beads by Rhea.  </p>
